# webserver
This project is about the implementation of a multi-threated web server that will be able to
deliver a HTML home page with its different pages to a web browser. This java application will
be continuously be listening to a fixed port and will be able to handle multiple simultaneous
service requests in parallel. Once it receives a connection and it is established, it will read the
HTTP request from the client, and then display the contents of the HTML page in the request.
The result will be a fully functional website that will allow the user to traverse through its pages
and assets.
